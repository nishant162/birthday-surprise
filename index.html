        <p>
            So finally, it's your birthday today! Wishing you a very happy birthday, Taxila! 🎉  
            May this day bring you the utmost joy and happiness. Thank you for always being there for me, helping me out, and in a way completing me, whether it's correcting my grammar, finishing my food or helping me become a more extroverted person. We've had plenty of fights in between, but honestly, they’re part of the fun!  
            Lastly, I hope you enjoy your special day, and a big congratulations on turning 21!❤  

            P.S. You wouldn’t find someone better than me, and neither would I, So..

            So, that’s how I, your digital friend, tried to create something special for you because you’ll always have a special place in my life.

            This little gift of mine may not be perfect as I’m not exactly a pro at creating pages like this, but every word here is filled with love and my sincerest efforts. I hope it brings a smile to your face because that’s all I wanted.

            Happiest birthday, dear! ❤
